- [X] Remove unecessary target platform
- [X] Default toolchain host is bazel host, can be override by module args, can be override by repo_env
- [X] Select sdk and compiler version
- [X] Verify hello_world output
- [X] Verify winsdk version
- [X] Enforce compiler and sdkversion numbers and display available list using invalid one
- [X] Fix 19041 winsdk and MSVC version below 14.44
- [X] Support multiple compiler version at the same time
- [X] Support WinSDK 19041 and 2026 channel at the same time
- [X] Make default MSVC and WinSDK version be explicit
- [X] LLVM: Support clang.exe targetting MSVC ABI
- [X] LLVM: Display the list of available llvm version on the error msg when specified version is not recognized
- [X] LLVM: Support clang-cl
- [X] Customization: Configure the compiler attribute for each toolchain kind (`msvc-cl`, `clang` and `clang-cl`) to be used in `select()` statements to conditionally configure your build based on the compiler type
- [ ] Cleanup default flags and define
- [ ] Feature: Support DLL compilation
- [ ] Feature: Support debug symbols.
- [ ] Feature: Support warning treasted as error
- [ ] Feature: Support both dynamic and static runtime linking (i.e /MT vd /MD)
- [ ] Feature: Support PGO
- [ ] Feature: Support LTO
- [ ] Lock File: Separate toolchains installation into two phase: preparation of a "lock" file, then consuming the lock file for installation.
- [ ] Lock File: Support lock file using the 'Update pattern'
- [ ] Enforce Visual Studio's EULA agreement: require a BAZEL_TOOLCHAINS_MSVC_AGREE_WITH_VS_EULA envvar. If does not exist, installation fails with the url pointing to EULA gotten from the channel manifest
- [ ] Enable ability to define multiple toolchain repo
- [ ] Remote Execution: verify it runs toolchains_msvc's toolchains properly
- [ ] Remote Execution: minimize toolchain's file dependency
- [ ] Customization: it is possible to override default features/args for `opt`, `fastbuild` and `dbg`. (flags and defines)
